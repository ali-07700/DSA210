Project Proposal: Identifying the Ideal ATP Player for Each Tournament

Motivation

The goal of this project is to analyze ATP Tour men's tennis matches from the 21st century to determine the ideal player attributes for each tournament. Tennis is a sport with fewer surprises compared to other sports, making it a strong candidate for predictive modeling using data science techniques. By leveraging historical match data, we aim to identify key performance metrics that contribute to tournament victories and use this information to forecast future success.

Data Source

The dataset will be obtained from Kaggle, which contains detailed match statistics from ATP tournaments. The dataset includes various performance indicators such as service percentage, double faults, aces, break points, and more. To enhance the dataset, we will derive new features by creating meaningful ratios, such as:

Average Aces per Service Point = (Total Aces) / (Total Service Points)

Break Point Conversion Rate = (Break Points Won) / (Break Points Opportunities)

Extra Data (If it will be needed)

If some information will be inadequate from formal website of ATP data will be organized.
