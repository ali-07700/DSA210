<h3 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Motivation</h3>
The goal of this project is to analyze ATP Tour men's tennis matches from the 21st century to determine the ideal player attributes for each tournament. Tennis is a sport with fewer surprises compared to others, making it a strong candidate for predictive modeling using data science techniques. By leveraging historical match data, I aim to identify key performance metrics that contribute to tournament victories and use this information to forecast future success.

<h3 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Description of Dataset</h3>
The dataset will be obtained from Kaggle, containing detailed match statistics from ATP tournaments. It includes various performance indicators such as:

Service Percentage
Double Faults
Aces
Break Points
To enhance the dataset, additional features will be derived, such as:

Average Aces per Service Point = (Total Aces) / (Total Service Points)
Break Point Conversion Rate = (Break Points Won) / (Break Point Opportunities)
<h3 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Additional Data Sources</h3>
If some information is inadequate, additional data will be researched and collected from the official ATP website or other reliable sources.

1. Data Collection

--The dataset will be sourced primarily from Kaggle.

--Supplementary data will be obtained from the official ATP website if necessary.

--Data will be cleaned and structured to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2.Data Processing and Insights

To extract meaningful insights from the dataset, the following steps will be followed:

--Data Cleaning

Handle missing or inconsistent values.
Normalize data formats for consistency.

--Feature Engineering

Generate new metrics based on performance indicators.
Apply domain knowledge to enhance dataset utility.

--Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use statistical methods and visualization tools to identify trends.
Compare player attributes across tournaments.
