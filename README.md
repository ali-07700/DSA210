# Project Proposal: Analyzing ATP Tour Men's Tennis Matches

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to analyze ATP Tour men's tennis matches from the 21st century to determine the ideal player attributes for each tournament. Tennis is a sport with fewer surprises compared to others, making it a strong candidate for predictive modeling using data science techniques. By leveraging historical match data, I aim to identify key performance metrics that contribute to tournament victories and use this information to forecast future success needings for every different tournament. The 2024 season will serve as a test dataset to measure the accuracy of these predictions.

## Description of Dataset
The dataset will be obtained from **Kaggle**, containing detailed match statistics from ATP tournaments. It includes various performance indicators such as:

- **Service Percentage**
- **Double Faults**
- **Aces**
- **Break Points**

To enhance the dataset, additional features will be derived, such as:

- **Average Aces per Service Point** = (Total Aces) / (Total Service Points)
- **Break Point Conversion Rate** = (Break Points Won) / (Break Point Opportunities)

## Additional Data Sources
If the dataset is inadequate, additional data will be researched and collected from:

- The **official ATP website**
- Other reliable tennis statistics sources

---

## Project Plan

### 1. Data Collection
- The primary dataset will be sourced from **Kaggle**.
- Supplementary data will be obtained from the **official ATP website** if necessary.
- Data will be cleaned and structured to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 2. Data Processing and Insights
To extract meaningful insights from the dataset, the following steps will be followed:

#### **Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Normalize data formats for consistency.

#### **Feature Engineering**
- Generate new metrics based on performance indicators.
- Apply domain knowledge to enhance dataset utility.

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Use statistical methods and visualization tools to identify trends.
- Compare player attributes across tournaments.

## Hypotheses

### Null Hypothesis (H₀)
- The performance metrics of ATP Tour tournament winners remain consistent over time, allowing for the prediction of future winners' match statistics based on historical trends.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)
- The performance metrics of ATP Tour tournament winners fluctuate unpredictably over time, making it impossible to reliably estimate future winners' match statistics.
