Project Proposal: Identifying the Ideal ATP Player for Each Tournament

Motivation

The goal of this project is to analyze ATP Tour men's tennis matches from the 21st century to determine the ideal player attributes for each tournament. Tennis is a sport with fewer surprises compared to others, making it a strong candidate for predictive modeling using data science techniques. By leveraging historical match data, I aim to identify key performance metrics that contribute to tournament victories and use this information to forecast future success.

Data Source

The dataset will be obtained from Kaggle, which contains detailed match statistics from ATP tournaments. It includes various performance indicators such as service percentage, double faults, aces, break points, and more. To enhance the dataset, I will derive new features by creating meaningful ratios or adding extra information, such as:

Average Aces per Service Point = (Total Aces) / (Total Service Points)
Break Point Conversion Rate = (Break Points Won) / (Break Point Opportunities)
Extra Data (If Needed)

If some information is inadequate, additional data will be researched and collected from the official ATP website or other reliable sources.
